# Phone, Photos Dump, Sorted

Lets say you have thousands of photos in your phone that you havent backed up yet. You now transfer them to your laptop/hard drive and want to sort them.

Manually creating folders and sorting thousands of photos can be time consuming so if you do not want to do that, you can run this python script and sort every photo to a folder based on the date they were taken.

In the script, just go to the variable that says **theFolderToBeSorted** at the end and provide the path to the directory you want to be sorted. 

This was supposed to be a more interesting project but I couldnt figure out other ways to sort out the photos so I guess yall have to settle for this simple script. 

Writing this readme took me more time than the script itself.
